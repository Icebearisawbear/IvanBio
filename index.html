    My name is Ivan Alas, and in my spare time, I enjoy exploring my creative side. One of my favorite hobbies is drawing, where I get to express myself visually and bring my ideas to life on paper. In addition to drawing, Iâ€™m passionate about coding games. The process of creating something interactive and watching it come to life through coding is incredibly satisfying for me.
Music also plays a big part in my life. I love playing the guitar, whether it's learning new songs or just jamming on my own. Singing is another outlet for me, and I have the privilege of singing in an ensemble. There's something special about harmonizing with others and sharing the experience of making music together.
Whether it's through art, technology, or music, I enjoy being creative and constantly challenging myself to learn and grow in these areas.
